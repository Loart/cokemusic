# Remake of CokeMusic CokeStudios

A playable Coke Music / Coke Studios online game redevelopment project (MyCoke). CokeMusic was an isometric online multiplayer game that launched in 2002 by Coca-Cola and created by Sulake Corporation. The primary purpose of the game was to market their products to a younger audience. There were several in-game features that kept players interested in the platform, aside from just marketing. Some of these features include private customizable rooms, inventory, creating music, chatting, trading, minigames, and others. The game was closed in 2007 and there are no plans to reopen.
